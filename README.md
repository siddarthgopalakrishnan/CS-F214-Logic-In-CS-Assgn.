# CS-F214-Logic-In-CS-Assgn.

# Assignment - 1
Day 1 - Implement a stack data structure.
Day 2 - Convert an infix expression into postfix.
Day 3 - Convert a postfix expression into a rooted binary tree.
        Traverse the parse tree to output the infix expression.
Day 4 - Evaluate the parse tree based on a given valuation.

# Assignment - 2
Day 1 - Code the 'impl_free' function to remove implications from a given propositional logic formula.
Day 2 - Convert given expression to nnf form (negation normal form).
Day 3 - Convert a postfix expression into CNF form (conjunctive normal form).

# Assignment - 3
(Using the NuSMV software for logic model checking)
Day 1 - Check if a pair of CTL formulas are equivalent. For those which are not, exhibit a
        model of one of the pair which is not a model of the other.
Day 2 - Make a logic model where all the given set of LTL/CTL formulas hold.
        Make a logic model where none of the given LTL/CTL formulas hold.
        
(ALL CODE WRITTEN IN C).
